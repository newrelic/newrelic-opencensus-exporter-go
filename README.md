# New Relic Go OpenCensus exporter [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go/nrcensus?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go/nrcensus)
The `nrcensus` package provides an exporter for sending OpenCensus stats and
traces to New Relic.


## Requirements
* [OpenCensus-Go](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-go) v0.10.0 or newer
* Go v1.8 or newer


## Install
To install, just go get this package with

```
$ go get -u github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go
```

## Using the exporter
To use the exporter, create a new Exporter and register it with OpenCensus.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go/nrcensus"
    "go.opencensus.io/stats/view"
    "go.opencensus.io/trace"
)

func main() {
    exporter, err := nrcensus.NewExporter("My-OpenCensus-App", "__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_INSIGHTS_API_KEY__")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    view.RegisterExporter(exporter)
    trace.RegisterExporter(exporter)

    // create stats, traces, etc
}
```
